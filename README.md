# Getting Started

## Cloud Service

- Demo: https://beaverhabits.com/demo
- Login: https://beaverhabits.com

## Self-Hosting

### Ship with Docker

Example:

```bash
docker run -d --name beaverhabits \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -e FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK=0 \
  -e HABITS_STORAGE=USER_DISK \
  -e MAX_USER_COUNT=1 \
  -v /path/to/host/directory:/app/.user/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  daya0576/beaverhabits:latest
```

P.S. The container starts as nobody to increase the security and make it OpenShift compatible.
To avoid [permission issues](https://github.com/daya0576/beaverhabits/discussions/31), ensure that the UID owning the host folder aligns with the UID of the user inside the container.

### Options:

| Name | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **HABITS_STORAGE**(str) | The `DATABASE` option stores everything in a single SQLite database file named habits.db. On the other hand, the `USER_DISK` option saves habits and records in a local json file. |
| **FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK**(int) | By default, the first day of the week is set as Monday. To change it to Sunday, you can set it as `6`. |
| **MAX_USER_COUNT**(int) | By setting it to `1`, you can prevent others from signing up in the future. |
| **ENABLE_IOS_STANDALONE**(bool) | Experiential feature to  enable standalone mode on iOS. The default setting is `false` |
| **INDEX_SHOW_HABIT_COUNT**(bool) | To display the total completed count badge on the main page. The default setting is `false` |
